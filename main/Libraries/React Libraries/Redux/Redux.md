## A JS/[[React]] library for managing your data and app state
## It is helpful, if:
- ### Your app is big with huge amount of data
- ### This data is shared amogn many others components that are placed in different levels of the app hierarchy
- ### There are complex logic of state/data updating, you want that logic to be understandable enought for other people and yourself when you see it years later
## Redux sorts the app data, simplifies access to that data from anywhere in your app and normalizes data change and update logic
